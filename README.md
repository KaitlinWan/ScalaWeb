### What is Scala?

Created by Martin Odersky and first released in 2003, Scala (short for Scalable Language) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed to cover the clunkiness and disadvantages of Java. 


Scala’s home is at Lightbend, Inc. (formerly known as Typesafe). This company provides an open-source platform for JVM based apps and even commercial support and training for Scala.


#### Although Scala runs on JVM and is interoperable with Java, it is not an extension of Java itself!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/KaitlinWan/ScalaWeb/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
