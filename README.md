## What is Scala?

Created by Martin Odersky and first released in 2003, Scala (short for Scalable Language) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed to cover the clunkiness and disadvantages of Java. 


Scalaâ€™s home is at Lightbend, Inc. (formerly known as Typesafe). This company provides an open-source platform for JVM based apps and even commercial support and training for Scala.


#### Although Scala runs on JVM and is interoperable with Java, it is not an extension of Java itself!



## Features!

#### Immutability
- val for immutable (var for mutable)
- List and Map are immutable by default


#### Composing Functions
- Writing functions within functions
- Higher order functions


#### Pattern Matching
- match keyword

#### Overloading Operators
- Operators can be redefined (+, -, !, etc.)

#### Traits
- Interfaces similar to abstract classes, but can hold both abstract and non-abstract methods


## Java vs. Scala

Like Java, Scala is object-oriented, meaning every value is an object. Unlike Java, Scala is also a true functional language, meaning every function is a value (and therefore every function is an object). Java 8 introduced lambda programming to make Java a functional language, but compared to Scala, the functional language capabilities of Scala reach further. 

## Paradigms

#### Java

- Object-Oriented (but primitives are not objects ) 
- Functional (only lambda programming )
- Backwards Compatible

#### Scala

- Object-Oriented (everything is an object!) 
- Functional (pattern matching, algebraic data types via case classes, type classes via implicits, tail-call optimisation, and immutability by default)
- Not Backwards Compatible( is binary compatible )
